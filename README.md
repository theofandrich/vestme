# VEST - Token Vesting Platform for Internet Computer

VEST is a decentralized application built on the Internet Computer that enables anyone to create custom vesting schedules and periodic payouts for ICRC-1, ICRC-2, and ICRC-3 compatible tokens.

## Live Deployments

You can access the deployed application through these links:

- **Frontend**: [https://kiw7s-xqaaa-aaaal-asawq-cai.icp0.io/](https://kiw7s-xqaaa-aaaal-asawq-cai.icp0.io/)
- **Backend** (Candid interface): [https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=kpxzg-2iaaa-aaaal-asawa-cai](https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.icp0.io/?id=kpxzg-2iaaa-aaaal-asawa-cai)

## Overview

VEST provides token creators and project teams with a secure, transparent mechanism to reward community members, investors, and contributors while implementing strategic token release schedules to promote long-term project stability.

## Features

- **Universal Token Support**: Compatible with all ICRC-1, ICRC-2, and ICRC-3 token standards on the Internet Computer
- **Customizable Vesting Schedules**: Create linear, cliff, or stepped vesting schedules
- **Periodic Payouts**: Set up automatic token releases at configurable intervals
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple dashboard for both creating and monitoring vesting contracts
- **Transparent Mechanics**: All vesting rules are stored on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Self-Service Management**: Recipients can track and claim their tokens as they become available
- **No Code Required**: Create sophisticated vesting mechanisms through an intuitive UI

## Use Cases

- **Project Token Distribution**: Allocate tokens to team members, advisors, and early contributors with appropriate lockup periods
- **Community Rewards**: Incentivize community engagement while ensuring long-term alignment
- **Meme Coin Stability**: Prevent immediate selling pressure from early adopters by implementing gradual token release
- **Investor Protection**: Demonstrate commitment to long-term growth with transparent token release schedules
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Programmatically distribute tokens for various DAO initiatives

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install) (Internet Computer SDK)
- Node.js and npm

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vest.git
cd vest

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the local Internet Computer replica
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

### Accessing the Application

Once deployed, the application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This is recommended before starting the frontend development server and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

For frontend development, start a development server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- Use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Technical Details

VEST integrates with the ICRC token standards on the Internet Computer:

- ICRC-1: Basic fungible token standard
- ICRC-2: Approval standard for delegated transfers
- ICRC-3: Batch operations standard

The platform uses secure canister architecture to guarantee that tokens are only released according to the predefined schedule, with all operations recorded transparently on the Internet Computer blockchain.
